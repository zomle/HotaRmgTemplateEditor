# Unofficial HOTA Rmg Template Editor (for HOTA 1.6.1)

THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED.

Decided to reimplement the rmg template editor provided by Hota (1.6.1), because it didn't support mirror templates, and also thought there were some UX issues with it.
Spent around 3 weeks of work on the project in December 2023, when suddenly on 31th December 2023 the Hota team released 1.7 with changes and updates to the rmg template editor as well.

Mirror templates are now supported, and there are changes to the file format as well. 

As the official editor resolved the main issues I had with it, I have little to no incentive to spend time working on the unofficial one. 
As I doubt I'll have the free time required to finish the project any time soon, I decided to publish the source code as is.

## Main UI updates
Displaying mirror templates:

Enabling/disabling heroes, artifacts, spells, secondary skills is easier:
